1. I only changed the RAM for the OS from 12,4 to 4 because 12 GB for the OS is a bit too much.

2. The Workload Factor affects the `mapreduce.job.maps` and `mapreduce.job.reduces` Gateway Settings, and it stands for the number of single tasks (maps or reduces) that should run in one NodeManager; in this case increasing it to a value higher than 2 doesn't matter since the lower bound is the number of vCPUS.
